# Hi there!

I am currently a 4th-year Physics (MPhys) student at the University of Manchester. I originate from Greece, where I attended secondary education and competed in Maths, Physics and Chemistry competitions. 

During my time at university, I have undertaken multiple internships revolving around programming and data analysis. My most recent work experience has been with the LHCb team at The University of Manchester, where I studied the matter/antimatter asymmetry in D0 meson decays. I have a deep-rooted passion for the implementation of machine learning/data analysis in a variety of physics fields. My selected MPhys project revolves around the geometrical interpretation of medical images using machine learning and its potential application in cancer research.

In the future, I am hoping to further explore the tech industry, specifically with projects that require machine learning/data analysis.
